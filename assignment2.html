            1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page 
            First, create list of content that will be needed for the website. Definetly you will need a short memoir of yourself, highlighting who you are, what are your areas of expertese and what you’re good at and what you can basically do for potential client. 
            Second of all, if possible, link a portfolio of what you alredy done, so the customer can see possible outcome of your work and decide if you and your skillset are right for him. Make it as easy as possible but showing crucial things like different website layouts’ styles etc. 
            Furthermore, create a “Contact” page with all the details that might be helpful reaching you. Make yourself available and visible, it will make your chances to get work a lot higher!<br>
            <br>
            1.2 Plan and create your website 
            Using Trello write what you want the content of your website to be, how you going to achieve it and possibly put a timeline with deadlines to each segment of your website. Consult content with others, it’s easy to overlook some important information and/or put info that is not crucial, therefore useless or unnecesary. Keep it clean and simple this will indicate that you know what you’re doing, have nice work ethics and are professional about it.<br>
            1.3 Selecting and using web site features and structure 
            Make the website stand out, but not all all cost. Use the features that you are comfortable using and know how they work. Be true to yourself first, it’s very easy to tell if something is way to far fetched, when there is no need for such thing. Remember, that the site represent you and your skills, not trends that are ongoing now. <br>
            1.4 Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent 
            Use consistent palette of colours, same font on each site so it looks like whole. Don’t put distractions, ephasise only what is really important and what you foremost want the potential customer to know about you. Don’t make the website too colorfull, unless you’re a graphic designer, then you cans go a little wild in the portfolio. Other that this, keep the website simple and professional, like a nice clean business card. <br>
            1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites 
            Best case scenario would be you creating your own content from start to the end, but if you for exaple, do’t feel to strong in writing, hire a copywriter, talk him through what do you want to achieve with your website and keep your content yours. Be aware of legal values of your content and when referring to someone else’s content, always say it loud and clear. You don’t want a legal action against you over such thing.<br> 
            1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them 
            It’s very important to remember about user of your site with visibilities. The more improvement’s you’ll make, the better, for number of reasons. It’s a good practice, to let users customise to some extend how your site looks, so they can use it in a way that suits their needs. For example I would include font size slider, for people with sight problems, so they can read the contents more easily. It would be nice to include also a bot that reads the contents for the blind and possibly with the ability to increase the volume for those with the hearing impaired. Remember also about colourblind people and implement a version of your site for them.<br> 
            1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites 
            Use filetypes that can be easily compressed but keep the golden mean with quality, too. Remember if you’ll put more and more files on the website it will load slower, and people have different devices and internet connection, so their experience might significatly differ. Try to keep it quite simple, so technical difficulties are not too big of an issue. <br>
            1.8 Storing and retrieving files effectively
            Sore your data in few different places, so when hardware fails, you have backup and the possiblity to create/bring your website back. Use cloud and external disks to keep the data safe and multiplied. <br>
            
            2.1 Preparing appropriate content for your site 
            Prepare content for the site carefully planning it. Decide which element are crucial to the project and which are not that important, find proper space for each, which will make your site clear, easy to browse and user friendly. Don’t overwhelm user with content, try to be as precise as possible about it. It will send good message about your work, build customer trust and made you look more professional. <br>
     
            2.3 Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation 
            Good navigation of the website is very important, as it is how client sees your work in the scale 1:1. Don’t put too many distracions to unnecesary directories, index the page in organised manner, with strong logic behind it. Don’t be afraid to be creative though, it will show your dedication, skills and finnesse. Just before submitting the final project show it to few people and gather their feedback about it, it might be very useful! <br>
            2.4 Select and use appropriate development techniques to link information across pages
            Make link that makes logical sense and are transparent for user mostly.  Put the content that is most important in the front(first page/s of the website) pushing the further content further with a connection from each page to each page. Link information using appropriate techniques like internet of things or use of material and module designing. <br>
            2.5 Changing file formats for documents if necessary to display on your site 
            Make sure all data is appropriate, so it can be read by as many devices as possible because you don’t want to exlude a huge group of users by that they cannot read a part of your website because some highly unpopular and niche format file was used. Change the file format to something common, that will most likely work under any conditions. <br>
            
            2.6 Error free pages that are fit for purpose 
            Male sure your website is error free as much as possible. Run test, aks other, let them look for errors and fix them when they are found. Not many things are as irritating as website not working properly, especially when it comes down to a line of business of creating webpages and content for them. <br>
