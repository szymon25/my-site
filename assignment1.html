    <p>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
            It’s hard to imagine running a business nowadays without online features. Society and technology are evolving together toward new, unknown ways of being a succesfull business owner and client. Purpose of the technological push is to make things as easy and quick as possible, for both sides. It can help keep the business safe and at the same time turn it from local to world wide in matter of days. This way new opportunities arise, challenging but most likely rewarding and most important of all - it’s rather unstoppable. <br>
        1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
            In order to make a successful project a combination of skills and right tools must be used. Depending on the project itself, group effort might be necessary, therefore teamwork is would be crucial to such project. Skills like coding, researching informations, knowledge of the product, it’s final recipents, what functionality it needs and planning ahead with completing “milestone” is a nice way to build anything. Distributing duties within team members with deadlines to them is very important, too. 
            When it comes to tools that can be used it can be anything that is commonly agreed to be used, taking factors like how easy each tool is to use, how effective it is, how it serves certain purposes in the process of creation is worth considering. It’s important to use right tools to the right job, otherwise the team might struggle and managing a project will become difficult if not impossible to finalize.<br> 
        1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.

        1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
        The first thing that comes to my mind when thinking about what might cause digital project to fail is the project being too complex(often with the deadline being too close). Reason for that might be the project is too ambitious, team not skilled and/or experienced enough and there’s a risk of taking wrong or not the best (for that particular case) creation tools. 
        The risk that might impact a digital project are running out of funds, not planned work good enough and making line of work very chaotic which might cause reaching milestones very hard, causing the low morale of the team. <br>
            Also, we live in a very fast developing world and at one point in the process of creation it might just happen that someone creates and publishes project like ours before us or at the same time, but which is just better. <br>
        1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? <br>
            First of all, one would need to outline the ultimate goal that is to be achieved. Then, considering factors like manpower, budget, and timeline with deadline create a sketch of what needs to be achieved and potential tools to achieve all goals. Compare tools to one another, look for patterns that fit best to teams preferences, skillset, mindset and what suits job the best. Think about to which platform your project is developed (iOS, Android or else?) and what needs to be achieved and how to achieve it easiest way possible. Remember about limitations of certain software and hardware and the possibilities they give in return and compared to other pieces of the puzzle. <br>
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control <br>
            Trello is very clean and nice environment to plan outcome of a project. It helped me to set goals, keep everything in one place so I know where I am with what at any level of developing a project. 
            GitHub helped me create an open source repository, started & manage a new brach of the project, get help from other users and open and merged a pull request etc.<br>
        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 
            General Data Protection Regulation significantly increased need to protect individuals personal data. Idividuals should get as much detail as possible on what their data will be processed for. Also consent request of data usage should be separated from terms & contidions and it should be made clear who will use and process data given by the individual. It applies to all new marketing campaigns as well all old ones which in that case needs amending.<br>
        
        2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello 
            Visual Studio Code - this program was crucial to creating skeleton of the website using javascript, html and css. It’s quite clear and easy to use, but quite complex and with a lot of functions, discovery of which and proper understanding might take a good moment. 
            Trello - this website was very useful when it comes to organizaing my workflow, plannig subject to be done, “crossing out” those which are already done and in a way Trello is like a virtual skechbook, where notes can be added. Very helpful in term of visualising work and what is ahead of us. 
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello 
            Yes I believe the selected tools were appropriate, helpfull and with proper functionality, that helped me organize my work in such manner, that led to creating aa codenation blog. I strongly advise usage of these tools for beginners as ther clarity and functionality makes this simply and fast to create. Most like there are other, more advanced pieces of software, but as for someone who stars his adventure with coding, Trello, Visual Studio etc. are perfect to start with. 
        2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? 
            I’m happy with my project in that way that I managed to finish it and make it work whatsoever. At the beginning of the course I did not believe in myself, that I can create any website, and in this way it is amazing to me, that it happened at all. I’m very happy about it, it’s a great feeling.
            Nevertheless, my website is  very basic, rather looks awfully and there is not too many options on it. There is definetly a ton of things that might have been done better and/or differently, but to be honest it is amazing to me that it have been created at all and I’m pretty gentle with judging myself about the poor childish looks and lack of function on the website, cause it’s just a first step in coding for me.
        2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project 
            If there would be more time and my skills were at higher level I would work more on visual side of the website cause it looks very crudely. There is a lot to improve in that field, that I am sure. I could and some graphics so it looks more user friendly and that would catch the eye of the users. 
        2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose  
            Well, on my website there is Index page, Assignment 1, Assignment 2 pages and links to my Trello board as well to GitHUb pages. It works alright just looks not that great, but one has to start somewhere. 
        
        3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 
            It is just a start for me with coding and creating websites etc. but I feel like these tools are created as user friendly as possible, at least for someone who knows what’s what. When thinking of benefits of certain tools first and main thing that comes to my mind is how popular each tool is and how easy is to find tutorials and guidance about it in the internet. It’s clear that when using some niche tool might impact your work and you could easily get stuck at some point and no help might be coming. Turning the tables round, when using a popular tool it’s easier to create, find help, but at the end of the day it might turn out that you’ve created another one of hundred of thousands project, that does not stand out at all. For me in professional website creating, finding a balance between those two things is the key. 
            Team work when creating a website seems like a great idea, especially when using tools like Slack and Trello. 
        3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency 
            I think it is very individual thing, but proper mindset is the key. Focus is very important and knowing your mind and body, and not pushing yourself too hard, taking breaks in the right moments is very important to the productiviti and creativity and may project over your whole work. Don’t work when exhausted, tired. Plan your work and your goals, if possible ask for guidance and help of others, more experienced people - for me, I would not be able to finish my coursework without the help of wonderful people form the coding course. 
        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
            I think, that my few future project would still easily be labelled as beginner level, I the line of work that was implemented over the coding course in codenation, perfectly met the needs and level of skills to create such entry level projects. That is why I would not change much, or actually even one thing, but rather let it evolve as needed. When the projects would become more serious I would simply look and use other tools for creation, but at this point I’m quite happy with what I’ve learned and I’m sure that there is a lot more to be discovered and adapted in great potential of tools that I used. 
        3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
            Testing should be made in a way that the end user finds no problems when using the product, so the test should be in depth, taking into consideration different scenarios.
