    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
            It’s hard to imagine running a business nowadays without online features. Society and technology are evolving together toward new, unknown ways of being a succesfull business owner and client. Purpose of the technological push is to make things as easy and quick as possible, for both sides. It can help keep the business safe and at the same time turn it from local to world wide in matter of days. This way new opportunities arise, challenging but most likely rewarding and most important of all - it’s rather unstoppable. <br>
        1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
            In order to make a successful project a combination of skills and right tools must be used. Depending on the project itself, group effort might be necessary, therefore teamwork is would be crucial to such project. Skills like coding, researching informations, knowledge of the product, it’s final recipents, what functionality it needs and planning ahead with completing “milestone” is a nice way to build anything. Distributing duties within team members with deadlines to them is very important, too. 
            When it comes to tools that can be used it can be anything that is commonly agreed to be used, taking factors like how easy each tool is to use, how effective it is, how it serves certain purposes in the process of creation is worth considering. It’s important to use right tools to the right job, otherwise the team might struggle and managing a project will become difficult if not impossible to finalize.<br> 
        1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.

        1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
        The first thing that comes to my mind when thinking about what might cause digital project to fail is the project being too complex(often with the deadline being too close). Reason for that might be the project is too ambitious, team not skilled and/or experienced enough and there’s a risk of taking wrong or not the best (for that particular case) creation tools. 
        The risk that might impact a digital project are running out of funds, not planned work good enough and making line of work very chaotic which might cause reaching milestones very hard, causing the low morale of the team. <br>
            Also, we live in a very fast developing world and at one point in the process of creation it might just happen that someone creates and publishes project like ours before us or at the same time, but which is just better. <br>
        1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? <br>
            First of all, one would need to outline the ultimate goal that is to be achieved. Then, considering factors like manpower, budget, and timeline with deadline create a sketch of what needs to be achieved and potential tools to achieve all goals. Compare tools to one another, look for patterns that fit best to teams preferences, skillset, mindset and what suits job the best. Think about to which platform your project is developed (iOS, Android or else?) and what needs to be achieved and how to achieve it easiest way possible. Remember about limitations of certain software and hardware and the possibilities they give in return and compared to other pieces of the puzzle. <br>
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control <br>
            Trello is very clean and nice environment to plan outcome of a project. It helped me to set goals, keep everything in one place so I know where I am with what at any level of developing a project. 
            GitHub helped me create an open source repository, started & manage a new brach of the project, get help from other users and open and merged a pull request etc.<br>
        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 
            General Data Protection Regulation significantly increased need to protect individuals personal data. Idividuals should get as much detail as possible on what their data will be processed for. Also consent request of data usage should be separated from terms & contidions and it should be made clear who will use and process data given by the individual. It applies to all new marketing campaigns as well all old ones which in that case needs amending.<br>
        
        2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello <br>
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello <br>
        2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?<br> 
        2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project<br> 
        2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose<br>
