    <h2>my codenation blog</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Szymon and I've interested in coding cause I think it it very creative way of creating things that I have very little knowlege about. Coding always seemed like something very, very complicated and yet so crucial to today's world proper functioning as the computers and the Internet are some common today.<br> Previously I've done cybesecurity course at codenation which have been very interesting and satisfying. I'm hoping that thanks to these courses I might shift my career different direction in the future, but for sure it's going to be very demanding but rewarding way. Hope you enjoy this website created as the part of the coursework.

        I've graduaded journalism in Poland and worked as a journalist for a newspaper Gazet Wroclawska - so far it have been the best work experience I've ever had and the worst money I've been paid for a full time job. Nevertheless over the period working there I've learned a lot, met fantastic people, some great mentors and ther guidance shaped me, my writing and the way I see the world.

        My main interest is cinema. I'm going to movies very often at least twice a week - at the time I've even run a blog with revievws of movies I've seen, both new and classics. When someone asks me what my favourite movie is, for years now I've got this one anwer prepered:"There's too many good movies to pick just one but if I've had to pick up three it would be The Fith Element by Luc Besson, Star Wars by George Lucas an The holy Mountain by alexandro Jodorowwsky". Said that, it's just the tip of the iceberg of great movies I love.<br> 
        Beside mvoies I really like writing, reading, playing video and board games and travelling. So far, my best place I've been just to visit is New York which made great impression and I think it would be great to go there again, but not neceseerily live there. <br> 
        When it comes do dogs and cats I'm definetly a dog person, but owed cats as well. Dogs are just more fun and adventureus.
